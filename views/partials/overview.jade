    p.indent.
        I'm a full-stack web developer with a deep understanding of every layer of web application architecture, and I absolutely love building stuff on the web.
        I've been at it since 2000, way back in the days of font tags, web safe colors, and using pixel.gif to make table based layouts work.
    //- The tools and techniques available today continue to make web development more and more exciting.

    p.indent.
        As a developer who enjoys front-end work, web development is in an incredibly exciting place.
        With the rise of client side SPA frameworks like React and Angular,
            alongside running Node on the server and for tooling,
            I have great hope for the future of building web based applications.

    //- Fantastic tools like
    //-     <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>,
    //-     <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>,
    //-     <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>,
    //-     and <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>
    //-     make for an amazing ecosystem and tool chain.
