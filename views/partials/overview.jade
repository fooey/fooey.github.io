    Hello! I'm Jason Rushton, and I'm a web developer.

  p.indent.
    I have extensive experience with nearly every level of web development:
      using JavaScript frameworks, including React and Angular, to build front-end UI's and applications &mdash;
      building back-ends using Node and ColdFusion &mdash;
      writing and optimizing HTML, CSS, and JS &mdash;
      creating and optimizing assets in Photoshop &mdash;
      designing, tuning, and managing SQL databases &mdash;
      writing and tuning T-SQL queries and stored procedures &mdash;
      installing, adminstrating, and tuning servers including Node, Heroku, Windows, IIS, SQL Server, and ColdFusion.

    I absolutely love building stuff on the web, and I've been at it since the days of font tags, web safe colors, and using pixel.gif to make table based layouts work.
    The tools and techniques available today continue to make web development more and more exciting.

    Web development is in an exciting place
      as the ascension of JavaScript provides amazing client side frameworks like React and Angular,
      server side JavaScript via Node and friends,
      and together, the beautiful capabilities of Isomophic JavaScript.

    Fantastic tools like
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>,
      <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>,
      <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>,
      and <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>
      make for an amazing ecosystem and tool chain.

  //-   | At the same time, I've designed, built, and maintained every aspect of serious, high performance, web applications which were required to scale to significant levels, including:
  //-   | handling as many as 5 million database transactions per day querying against over 100 million records;
  //-   | 10's of thousands of API calls per day going in both directions;
  //-   | concurrently supporting hundreds of customer support agents across multiple continents within a custom built CRM;
  //-   | and in one year alone, processing more than 10,000,000 credit card transactions.
