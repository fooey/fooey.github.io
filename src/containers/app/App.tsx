      <p>Hello! I'm Jason Rushton, and I'm a web developer.</p>
      <p>I'm a full-stack web developer with a deep understanding of every layer of web application architecture. I’m truly passionate about building applications on the web, and I've been at it since 2000 — way back in the days of font tags, web safe colors, and using pixel.gif to make table based layouts work.</p>
      <p>As a web developer who enjoys and focuses on front-end web applications, I believe the industry is in an amazing place, and has incredible potential. With the rise of client side SPA frameworks like React.js and Angular.js, alongside leveraging Node.js on the server and for tooling, I'm very excited for the future of building web based applications.</p>
