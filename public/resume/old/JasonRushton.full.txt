- Backend Web Development

Designed, built, and maintained every aspect of a high performance, web application which scale up to handle daily loads of over 500,000 page requests along with 10's of thousands of calls to the inbound sales API. All while concurrently supporting hundreds of Customer Support Agents across multiple continents within this custom built CRM, which in one year alone, processed more than 10,000,000 credit card transactions.


- Frontend Web Development

I’m extremely familiar with all the basic building blocks of building web app including HTML, CSS and JavaScript including libraries like jQuery and Underscore, and CSS Frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap.

Over the last couple years, I’ve put great effort into building JavaScript heavy “thin client” apps which attempt to minimize backend server rendering and calculations and instead rely on asynchronous API calls and client side template rendering

I have extensive experience modeling databases for both scalability and normalization. I'm very capable with querying and tuning databases and indexes, as well as mass data imports and exports.

The CRM application I built and tuned ended up with over 100 million records, and had loads reaching 5 million transactions per day.


- Web Optimization and Scaling

I'm experienced with optimization techniques like caching at every level of the web stack, minification and merging of CSS and JS, as well as optimizing images for size and spriting potential.
